# TupiShop

## Overview
TupiShop is a brazilian open source ecommerce platform for online stores that need improved performance for high traffic. We doesnt have intent to provide final store in many cases but a really good start to build a professional ecommerce.

We think that our difference for any other ecommerce platforms is because we consider any suggestions that you can make to us. We accept any help by anyone!

Enjoy the brazilian hospitality =P

## OMG, another one? Why?
We have been working for some time with e-commerce and none of the available platforms have supplied us nicely, there was always some incompatibility with a real-world business model.

And now we have enough time and resources to start the TupiShop project with the goal of building an e-commerce in the way that we think is enough to be simple to configure and with basic features without complications.

### And why not suggest improvements to existing platforms?
Trust us, we tried several times! Anyone who works with the current platforms knows the regret in suggesting something. We can say that their maintainers are not very friendly, sometimes arrogant. Well, I think the world knows how cool Brazilians are. We would love for you to help us with suggestions and criticisms.

## Making a suggestion
Please create a bug report if you think something needs improving / adding. As said before: we consider everything!

## Requirements
- [Phalcon Extension 3.1.1](https://phalconphp.com/pt/download/linux) at least
- [Phalcon DevTools](https://phalconphp.com/pt/download/tools) for cli (models and migration)
- PHP 7.0 for better performance, but works as well with PHP 5.4+

## Why Phalcon Framework?
Bem, nós não costumamos ser amantes de frameworks mas eventualmente as acompanhamos. Em 2015 o Phalcon Framework chamou nossa atenção pela sua performance muito superior às demais.
